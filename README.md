# Unity Dialogue System

Node based Dialogue System made for Unity using the Experimental GraphView API.

This is a simple Dialogue System that allows one to create dialogues through nodes and group them using groups.

This also contains a very basic custom inspector that allows the user to choose the starting dialogue.
